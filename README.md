Confieselo
=========

This was a little experiment I did, this is a page when users can make confesions, it use mongo db as database.

I moved this project from bitbucket where I had it.


Using:

rails '4.1.4'
MongoDb with MongoId
Facebook Login
CanCan
Cloudinary for image manipulation
capistrano for deploying
