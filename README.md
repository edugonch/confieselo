Confieselo
=========

This was a little experiment I did, this is a page when users can make confesions, it use mongo db as database.

I moved this project from bitbucket where I had it. The code is from the begining of 2014.


Using :

* rails '4.1.4'
* MongoDb with MongoId
* Facebook Login
* CanCan
* Cloudinary for image manipulation
* capistrano for deploying
